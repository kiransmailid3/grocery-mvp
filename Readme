I want to create an app or website, where I want to get the groceries cheap from several grocery shops in my vicinity around 5km.
The user can give their address or pin code.
for example there are 5 items, like tomatoes, apples, bread, milk and cheese. I want an output such as pick tomatoes and cheese from grocery shop A, then apples from grocery shop B, bread and milk from grocery shop C.
Also based on the address and the distance between the shops, the output from the app/website should show how to navigate, example, start from home to grocery shop B to grocery shop C to grocery shop C to home.
